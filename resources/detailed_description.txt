Pinned tabs in Chrome are nice, but if you expect to always have the same set of pinned tabs open, you may be frustrated by how unpersistent they are.

Pushpin is here to help!

Pushpin lets you:
ðŸ“Œ Configure your favorite set of pinned tabs
ðŸ“Œ Reset all or each pinned tab back to your configuration
ðŸ“Œ Move your pinned tabs to the front window without reloading them
ðŸ“Œ Set keyboard shortcuts for each pinned tab (shortcuts can be global)
ðŸ“Œ Modify your keyboard shortcuts so that Ctrl-n will open the n-th unpinned tab
