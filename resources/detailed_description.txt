Pinned tabs in Chrome are nice, but if you expect to always have the same set of pinned tabs open, you may be frustrated by how unpersistent they are. Pushpin is here to help.


Configure your favorite set of pinned tabs in the extension options.

Click Pushpin to make the pinned tabs appear in the current window. If they're open, Pushpin will move them to the current window. This will preserve tab settings, like whether audio is muted. If they're not open, Pushpin will open them for you.

Webapps are buggy sometimes, especially after going offline. Double-click Pushpin to reload all your pinned tabs.
